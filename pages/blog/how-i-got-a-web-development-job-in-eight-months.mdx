Especially since I went the self taught route. That by itself is a whole other article, but for the mean time I'll keep the explanation simple.

Firstly, I had been teaching myself various things about programming since I was about 12. I learned some python in Blender,
some C# in Unity, and some java from The Cherno on YouTube. I took many months, sometimes years, of breaks, but that doesn't
change the fact that I wasn't completely new to programming in general. I don't want to sell myself short, though, I was _completely_
new to web development. Didn't even know what LeetCode was.

Secondly, I got very lucky. I started applying to many places, probably 200 or more, and happened to get an email back from my
current company a long time later because someone had move from the Front End team to the Back End team and they were going back through
the piles of resumes. There was competition from other candidates, but ultimatley I landed the job.

So, yes, I got lucky, but I'm not the end all be all of bad programmers either. Afterall I do still have my job six months later.
